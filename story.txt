There once was a girl named Gabriella who lived with her grandmother on a farm. One day Gabriella's grandmother asked her to go into town to buy a new dress for church. Gabriella's grandmother gave Gabriella $50 to buy a dress, but on her way to the dress store she saw many other things that she would rather buy.
