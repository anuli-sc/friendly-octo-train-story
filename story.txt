There once was a girl named Gabriella who lived with her grandmother on a farm. One day Gabriella's grandmother asked her to go into town to buy a new dress for church. Gabriella's grandmother gave Gabriella $50 to buy a dress, but on her way to the dress store she saw many other things that she would rather buy.

So instead of dress, Gabriella bought a tons of snacks and and wanted to share them with her grandmother. But her grandmother doesn't like snacks.

Gabriella then used the snacks to exchange some food from friends, so that she could cook for her grandmother.
